## Features
Cross-Browser Support: Works with multiple browsers and platforms.
Modular Design: Built using Page Object Model (POM) or Screenplay Pattern for easy maintenance.
BDD Support: Utilize Gherkin syntax to write clear and understandable test cases.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports Scenario Outlines and data-driven tests from multiple sources.
Integrated Reporting: Generates detailed reports with Allure.
## Getting Started

## Writing Test Cases
Test cases should be written in Gherkin format and placed in the /tests directory.
Each test should clearly describe the scenario and expected outcomes.
Example
gherkin

Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I navigate to the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
## Running Tests
To execute the tests, run:

#3 Reporting
After running tests, generate reports using Allure:

allure serve reports/
This will open a visual report in your browser.

## Data Sources
The framework supports data-driven testing from various sources:

Excel: Use exceljs to read data.
Database: Connect using pg for PostgreSQL or similar libraries.
Redis: Integrate using the redis package.
